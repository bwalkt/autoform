# React integration for AutoForm

This package provides a React integration for AutoForm. You'll most likely use UI-library specific packages like `@bwalkt/mui` instead of this package - unless you want to create your own integration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @bwalkt/react
```

For more information on how to use this package, see the [AutoForm documentation](https://autoform.vantezzen.io/docs/react/getting-started).
