# AutoForm Core

This package provides the core functionality for AutoForm. You'll most likely use UI-library specific packages like `@bwalkt/mui` instead of this package - unless you want to create your own renderer.

The core is agnostic to both the schema and the UI library used to render the form.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @bwalkt/core
```

For more information on how to use this package, see the [AutoForm documentation](https://autoform.vantezzen.io/docs/react/getting-started).
